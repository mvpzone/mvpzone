### Hello 👋

I am Vinesh, a cybersecurity practitioner in the global cybersecurity action team at Google. I am an engineer/trouble maker on the cloud open source team and an ambassador of the Google For Startups program. I am the one Developers yell at when stuff isn't working how they want; Also the one the engineers yell at when the developers aren't using it right. I help folks stay safe, have fun & succeed in a digital world by harnessing software.

I strive and wish for a digital world where anyone can experience freedom, wealth and success while staying safe and having fun…

Want to collaborate. Love to hear from you…
