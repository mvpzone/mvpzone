### Bio
I am a cybersecurity practitioner in the global cybersecurity action team at Google. I am an engineer/trouble maker on the cloud open source team and an ambassador of the Google For Startups program. I am the one Developers yell at when stuff isn't working how they want; Also the one the engineers yell at when the developers aren't using it right. I help everyone stay safe, innovate & succeed in a digital world by harnessing the power of software. 

I am fascinated by the impact of technology on our daily experiences and constantly thinking of ways to make technology frictionless and universally accessible. When not thinking about crafting such solutions you can usually find me reading about philosophy, psychology or technology. 

I love to explore the wilderness with my 4 legged friend (Happy) and I am quite capable of making Happy, sad. 

I strive and wish for a digital world where anyone can experience freedom, wealth and success while staying safe and having fun… 

Want to collaborate. Love to hear from you…
